Deep Learning with Julia is a book about how to do various deep learning
tasks using the Julia programming language and specifically the Flux.jl
package. The intent of the book is to prove that serious deep learning
can be done in Julia and that the ecosystem as a whole is ready for the
spotlight.

\hypertarget{getting-started}{%
\section{Getting Started}\label{getting-started}}

All of the code and resources for this book are stored here on GitHub
and deployed to \url{https://deeplearningwithjulia.com}.

This book is built via \href{https://books.huijzer.xyz}{Books.jl} and is
made possible by the Julia programming language
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-bezanson2017julia}{Bezanson et al., 2017}) and
\href{https://github.com/jgm/pandoc}{pandoc}.

\hypertarget{sec:preface}{%
\chapter{Preface}\label{sec:preface}}

The world is undergoing a radical shift. Machine Learning (and
specifically Deep Learning) uses are being accelerated across every
industry and domain. Humans have unlocked a significant new tool, the
likes of which has not been seen since the software explosion took place
in the early 2000's. But what does this mean for developers and those
interested in working with these tools?

Like many field in the technology industry, there is a great deal of
gate keeping in the Machine Learning community. Those in positions of
power often make it seem as though using and understanding machine
learning is reserved for those with PhD's and years of experience. This
could not be farther from the truth. As the use of machine learning has
increased, the barrier to entry have been slowly torn down. The result
is that students with minimal programming and machine learning
experience can now enter into the field and make advancements on the
current state of the art.

In this book, we will touch on: - What the Julia Programming Language is
and why we will be using it - What Deep Learning is - Various
applications of Deep Learning

\hypertarget{sec:why_deep_learning}{%
\section{Why Deep Learning?}\label{sec:why_deep_learning}}

Why are we focusing on Deep Learning? How is that any different than
machine learning? These are both great questions. We will delve more
into the details in chapter 2, but the quick answer is that deep
learning is a specific machine learning technique and the reason we want
to focus on it is that many of the advancements as well as applications
you have read about under the ``AI'' or ``Machine Learning'' title, are
actually deep learning solutions under the hood. Use cases like Self
Driving cars, digital voice assistants, recommendation engines (like on
YouTube and Netflix) are all powered by Deep Learning.

\hypertarget{sec:book_motivation}{%
\section{Why does this book exist?}\label{sec:book_motivation}}

What was the point of writing this book? Currently, almost all deep
learning practitioners use Python and most Deep Learning books focus on
Python. Given the popularity of the language, this is a natural choice,
especially given the prevalence of high quality libraries like Pandas,
Numpy, Tensorflow, Pytorch, etc. However, as the Julia programming
language continues to grow and gain adoption, more and more users are
coming and expecting a world class deep learning experience. While we
have Flux.jl for deep learning in Julia, there are not currently any
resources for learning about deep learning in Julia. Conversely, in the
Python ecosystem, there are at least 4-5 foundational deep learning
books which I personally used during my learning journey and I found to
be excellent. The goal for this book is to show people that doing deep
learning in Julia is a viable choice and more so than that, could
actually come with significant advantages over other languages and
frameworks.

\hypertarget{sec:acknowledgements}{%
\section{Acknowledgements}\label{sec:acknowledgements}}

I could write an entire book itself just going through all of the folks
who have helped me get here. In general, this book, my career and life,
are a product of support from a large group of amazing folks. From my
parents and family, to teachers and professors, and especially the Julia
community, without which, there would be no one reading this text. I
will save you all from the rest of the sappy narrative but know that I
appreciate each and every person who helped me get here.

\hypertarget{sec:why_julia}{%
\chapter{Why Julia}\label{sec:why_julia}}

If you have decided to pick up this book, you likely have heard or been
told things about the awesome power of the Julia programming language.
This chapter is dedicated for those who have not yet been convinced that
Julia is the language of the future. If I don't need to convince you,
please skip to the next chapter to dive into the fun. My personal hope
is that one day soon, the Julia community will be large and mature
enough that authors of Julia books need not include a ``Why Julia''
chapter. Until we get to that point, it is still worth it to talk about
the benefits. Now back to Julia!

The Julia programming language was created in 2012 by a group of folks
who believed that the scientific computing ecosystem could be better.
They were fed up with MATLAB and Python because the former is not Open
Source and pay to play while the latter is generally not performant
enough to scale up in production environments. Researchers and
programmers alike would generally use these tools for prototyping, but
when it came time to deploy, they would be forced to rewrite their code
in C++ or C in order to meet the performance thresholds required.

This phenomenon was coined as the ``Two Language Problem'' and Julia was
created, in large part, to address it. After many years of hard work by
Stefan Karpinski, Alan Edelman, Viral Shah, Jeff Bezanson, and
enthusiastic contributors around the world, the language hit its 1.0
version release in 2018. The 1.0 release marked a huge milestone for the
Julia community in terms of stability and the gave confidence to users
that Julia would be along for the long haul.

In late 2021, Julia 1.6 was selected as the long term supported release.
We will be using Julia 1.6 in this book so that the content will be as
stable as possible for years to come.

Now that we have some historical context on Julia and why it was
created, let us next move through some additional features which make
Julia a natural choice for Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and more
generally, science.

\hypertarget{sec:dispatch}{%
\section{Multiple Dispatch}\label{sec:dispatch}}

There is no one better to talk about the idea Multiple Dispatch and its
use in Julia than Stefan Karpinski. In a 2019 JuliaCon talk titled ``The
Unreasonable effectiveness of Multiple Dispatch''
(https://youtu.be/kc9HwsxE1OY), Stefan went on to state that the Julia
ecosystem has more code re-use than any ecosystem he has ever seen.
Multiple Dispatch is the paradigm that allows this to happen. So what is
Multiple Dispatch and why is it so unreasonably effective? For the
latter point, I suggest watching Stefan's talk, there is no sense in
re-stating what he already put eloquently. So back to the main question,
what is multiple dispatch? The main idea here is that you can write
multiple functions with the same name, which dispatch (or are called
dynamically) depending on the types of the input arguments. This idea is
not something necessarily unique to Julia, other languages have multiple
dispatch or similar concepts. But the way in which it is used and
implemented in Julia is the secret sauce. Let us now look at a quick
example:

\hypertarget{sec:packages}{%
\section{Package Management}\label{sec:packages}}

Most people are unlikely to choose a programming language based on its
package manager (or lack thereof). Despite this reality, the Julia
package manager is one of those features that really makes me appreciate
the language. Julia's package manager is extremely simple to work with
and also enables much more reproducible code. Let us explore and see how
this is the case:

There are two different fundamental ways of working with packages in
Julia: via the REPL's Pkg mode and via the Pkg package. I will focus on
using the REPL since it is extremely intuitive for new users. You can
start by launching Julia in the terminal. Then, type
\passthrough{\lstinline!]!} in which should take you into Pkg mode:

\begin{lstlisting}
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.6.3 (2021-09-23)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |

(@v1.6) pkg> 
\end{lstlisting}

From here, one of the natural things to do is check what commands you
can run in the package manager. To do this, type an
\passthrough{\lstinline!?!} in and press enter/return.

You will see all the possible commands:

\begin{lstlisting}
(@v1.6) pkg> ?
  Welcome to the Pkg REPL-mode. To return to the julia> prompt, either press
  backspace when the input line is empty or press Ctrl+C.

  Synopsis

  pkg> cmd [opts] [args]

  Multiple commands can be given on the same line by interleaving a ; between
  the commands. Some commands have an alias, indicated below.

  Commands

  activate: set the primary environment the package manager manipulates

  add: add packages to project

  build: run the build script for packages

  develop, dev: clone the full package repo locally for development
  ...
  ...
\end{lstlisting}

Some of the most common commands you will use are
\passthrough{\lstinline!add!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!activate!},
\passthrough{\lstinline!status!} (or the shorthand
\passthrough{\lstinline!st!}), and \passthrough{\lstinline!remove!} (or
the shorthand \passthrough{\lstinline!rm!}). In this book, we will be
using Flux.jl, so if you want to play around with the package, you can
simply install it by typing \passthrough{\lstinline!add Flux!}.

After the install finishes, you can check your package environment by
typing \passthrough{\lstinline!status!}:

\begin{lstlisting}
(@v1.6) pkg> status
      Status `~/.julia/environments/v1.6/Project.toml`
  [587475ba] Flux v0.12.7
\end{lstlisting}

The package manager automatically shows the file which is managing the
packages and their versions. In this case, it is
\passthrough{\lstinline!\~/.julia/environments/v1.6/Project.toml!}. As a
general best practice, it is recommend to always use local environments
instead of making changes to your main Julia environment. You can do
this by activating a new environment.

\begin{lstlisting}
julia> pwd()
"/Users/logankilpatrick"

shell> cd Desktop # type `;` to enter the shell mode from the REPL
/Users/logankilpatrick/Desktop

(@v1.6) pkg> activate .
  Activating new environment at `~/Desktop/Project.toml`
\end{lstlisting}

In the code above, you can see I started out in my main user folder. I
then entered the shell mode by typing \passthrough{\lstinline!;!} and
used the change directory command to switch to my Desktop folder. From
there, I did \passthrough{\lstinline!activate .!} which activates the
current folder I am in. I can confirm this by typing
\passthrough{\lstinline!status!}:

\begin{lstlisting}
(Desktop) pkg> status
      Status `~/Desktop/Project.toml` (empty project)
\end{lstlisting}

and you can see the newly created project is empty.

Hopefully these examples give you a sense of how easy to user and
powerful the Julia package manager is. You can read more about working
with packages from the Pkg.jl docs:
https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/getting-started/.

\hypertarget{sec:community}{%
\section{The Julia Community}\label{sec:community}}

I would be remiss if I did not mention the Julia community itself as one
of the core features of the ecosystem. Without such an incredible
community, Julia would not be what it is today. But what makes the Julia
community so great you might ask?

\hypertarget{sec:transfer_learning}{%
\chapter{Transfer Learning}\label{sec:transfer_learning}}

Transfer learning is one of the most useful and underrated deep learning
tools. It allows us to take a model which was trained on a large data
set, and ``fine tune'' it (more on what that means later) to work well
for our specific use-case. It gets its name from the idea of learned
information being transferred from one use case to another.

You might be asking yourself, why is this so powerful? Well, during the
learning process, a deep learning model has to figure out things like
what an edge looks like in the case of computer vision. This might seem
like an abstract idea but it is a critical step for the model to learn
how to distinguish between multiple objects. When we use transfer
learning, many of these ideas have already been learned by the existing
model we are starting with. This means that we do not need to spend as
long training since already know some info about objects, even though
the pre-trained model might never has seen data similar to the data you
will be feeding into it.

Here is a simple example to try and illustrate why transfer learning
works so well: imagine you are trying to teach someone what a car is.
This person has never seen a car nor knows what it does. This person has
seen a bicycle before and in fact uses one everyday. You can now explain
to the person what a car is in terms of how it relates to a bike. The
transfer learning process is much like this. Use the existing info that
the model has learned and build off of that for some specific situation.

\hypertarget{sec:pre-trained_models}{%
\section{Pre-trained Models}\label{sec:pre-trained_models}}

The way in which we do transfer learning in the context of deep learning
is with pre-trained models. But what is a pre-trained model? In general,
we are referring to a model which has been trained on a specific data
set. We will be exploring transfer learning in the context of computer
vision so this means the model saw many images, each with a label which
says what it is, and over time the model learned to correctly say the
label given the image. There are a lot of different ideas going on here:
computer vision, datasets, transfer learning, and more. \emph{If any of
this is not making sense, that is totally expected, there is both a lot
of jargon as well as many new ideas being introduced. Try to stay
focused on the high level and we will come back to many of these topics
in more detail.}

Now that we know the high level idea of transfer learning, let us dive
into a real example using Flux. To give some context, in other machine
learning frameworks like PyTorch, the pre-trained models are built right
into PyTorch itself. In the Flux ecosystem however, the pre-trained
models live in a package called
\href{https://github.com/FluxML/Metalhead.jl}{Metalhead.jl}. Metalhead
is built to work with the Flux ecosystem so you do not need to work
about writing compatibility issues.

\hypertarget{sec:metalhead}{%
\section{Metalhead.jl}\label{sec:metalhead}}

Let us start out by installing Metalhead in the package manager by doing
\passthrough{\lstinline!add Metalhead!}. Then we can type
\passthrough{\lstinline!using Flux, MetalHead!} into a Julia terminal
session. Metalhead provides a number of different model types like
\passthrough{\lstinline!resnet!}, \passthrough{\lstinline!vgg!}, and
more. Over the course of your deep learning experience, you will become
more familiar with these model types as they represent some of the most
common models for transfer learning. Before we dive into actually using
pre-trained models, we will first take a quick look at the model
structure which we get from Metalhead and Flux.

\begin{lstlisting}
julia> model = ResNet50(pretrain=false)
ResNet(
  Chain(
    Chain(
      Conv((7, 7), 3 => 64, pad=3, stride=2),  # 9_472 parameters
      BatchNorm(64, relu),              # 128 parameters, plus 128
      MaxPool((3, 3), pad=1, stride=2),
      Parallel(
        Metalhead.var"#18#20"(),
        Chain(
          Conv((1, 1), 64 => 64, bias=false),  # 4_096 parameters
          BatchNorm(64, relu),          # 128 parameters, plus 128
          Conv((3, 3), 64 => 64, pad=1, bias=false),  # 36_864 parameters
          BatchNorm(64, relu),          # 128 parameters, plus 128
          Conv((1, 1), 64 => 256, bias=false),  # 16_384 parameters
          BatchNorm(256),               # 512 parameters, plus 512
        ),
        Chain(
          Conv((1, 1), 64 => 256, bias=false),  # 16_384 parameters
          BatchNorm(256),               # 512 parameters, plus 512
        ),
      ),
      ...
      ...
      ...
    Chain(
      AdaptiveMeanPool((1, 1)),
      Flux.flatten,
      Dense(2048, 1000),                # 2_049_000 parameters
    ),
  ),
)         # Total: 162 trainable arrays, 25_557_096 parameters,
          # plus 106 non-trainable, 53_120 parameters, summarysize 97.749 MiB.
\end{lstlisting}

Now that is a lot to take in (even though most of the model has been
omitted for space reasons), but at a high level, it represents the
structure of the \passthrough{\lstinline!ResNet50!} model as defined in
Flux. Notably, the \passthrough{\lstinline!50!} in
\passthrough{\lstinline!ResNet50!} comes from the fact that the model
has 50 layers. There are other ResNet like models with different numbers
of layers but with the same overall structure.
